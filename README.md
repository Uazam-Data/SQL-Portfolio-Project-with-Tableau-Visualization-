COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

Project Overview:
Developed an SQL-based analysis of COVID-19 data focusing on death counts, vaccination rates, and infection statistics across various regions. Utilized a combination of complex SQL queries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and temporary tables to derive meaningful insights.

Key Achievements:

1.	Data Retrieval and Cleaning:
o	Extracted relevant COVID-19 data from Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations tables while ensuring that entries with null continent values were excluded.
o	Organized data by various metrics, such as total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population.

3.	Statistical Analysis:
o	Calculated the Death Percentage for COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom to analyse the likelihood of dying if infected.
o	Analysed Total Cases vs. Total Population to determine what percentage of the population was infected, identifying trends in different locations.

5.	Infection and Death Rates:
o	Identified countries with the highest infection rates relative to their populations, providing insights into regions most affected by COVID-19.
o	Compiled data on countries with the highest total death counts to highlight critical areas of concern.

7.	Continental Analysis:
o	Evaluated death counts per continent to understand regional impacts of the pandemic, facilitating comparative analysis across different geographical areas

8.	Global Metrics:
o	Aggregated global new cases and deaths, calculating overall death percentages to present a high-level overview of the pandemic's progression.

10.	Vaccination Insights:
o	Merged vaccination data with death statistics to assess the impact of vaccination on population health.
o	Created a rolling total of vaccinated individuals, allowing for dynamic insights into vaccination trends over time.

12.	Advanced SQL Techniques:
o	Utilized Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables to streamline data manipulation and enhance query performance.
o	Created a view (Percent Population Vaccinated) for easier access to vaccination metrics for future analyses and visualizations

13.	Data Visualization Preparation:
o	Structured the data for visualization purposes, making it easier to generate insights through data visualization tools in future phases of the project.
Tools and Technologies Used:
•	SQL (T-SQL for SQL Server)
•	Data analysis techniques
•	Data visualization (potential integration with tools like Tableau)
